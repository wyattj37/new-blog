      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;stepping-on-cracks-fairly&#34;&gt;Stepping on Cracks Fairly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I walk down a sidewalk, I have a hard time not thinking about stepping on the cracks. Specifically, I like for my left and right foot to step on a crack the same amount of times. I don&amp;rsquo;t completely obsess over it, but it&amp;rsquo;s always somewhere between the front and back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was on a walk earlier today, it was closer to the front. I made an exaggerated step with my right leg to extend my gait and find a crack where my right foot would land - evening up the crack tally between legs. As I made that step, I began to wonder if you could enumerate the number of crack steps during a walk. At first pass it seemed plausible: your foot size is fixed, your gait is (mostly) fixed, and the distance between cracks is (once again, mostly) fixed. I evenly crack-stepped home and got out the notepad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
