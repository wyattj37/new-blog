      <description>&lt;p&gt;Heart rate variability (HRV) is the primary metric that the WHOOP fitness band uses to calculate your recovery. In this article I look at just how much HRV contributes to recovery, plus how a high HRV variance can make things tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-a-whoop-recovery-score&#34;&gt;What is a WHOOP Recovery Score&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHOOP fitness band is a product that tracks your activity throughout the day by measuring primarily your heart rate. In addition, and more importantly, it tracks your recovery during sleep. The WHOOP website (and my personal experience) will tell you HRV is the primary contributer to calculating recovery. What exactly HRV is and why it&amp;rsquo;s so important is something I surely will explain worse than WHOOP themselves, so find out more about that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/heart-rate-variability-hrv/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
