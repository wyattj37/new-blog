      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who is the champion of tennis as a matter of direct succession? You can find the website I&amp;rsquo;ve made &lt;a href=&#34;https://tennis-belt.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cfb-belt.com/&#34;&gt;College Football belt&lt;/a&gt;, I started my own tracker for the men and women&amp;rsquo;s tennis belt. Essentially, the first champion on tour is given the belt. When that player is beaten, the winning player takes the belt. As long as the belt-holder wins, they keep the belt until someone comes and usurps them. And so it travels around between the players. It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
