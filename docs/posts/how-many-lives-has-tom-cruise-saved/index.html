    <div class="content">
      <p>Going movie by movie enumerating Tom&rsquo;s heroics.</p>
<h3 id="legend-1985"><strong>Legend (1985)</strong> <a href="#legend-1985" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>In what one might call his heroic debut, Tom Cruise has his first foray into saving the world. His character Jack helps stop the Lord of Darkness from killing the last two unicorns and sending the world into darkness. It’s not clear exactly what outcome this will have on humanity, and the movie is set in a fantasy world, so it’s also unclear how many “real lives” are at stake. At least a few million and potentially the whole population. Let’s go with 5 billion.</p>
<h3 id="top-gun-1986"><strong>Top Gun (1986)</strong> <a href="#top-gun-1986" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>At the end of the movie Maverick saves Ice Man. 1 life.</p>
<h3 id="born-on-the-fourth-of-july-1989"><strong>Born on the Fourth of July (1989)</strong> <a href="#born-on-the-fourth-of-july-1989" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Tom Cruise participates in some activism, which might have the potential to save future lives. Let’s say he was a decent activist that will prevent some future conflict and give him 10,000 lives.</p>
<h3 id="a-few-good-men-1992"><strong>A Few Good Men (1992)</strong> <a href="#a-few-good-men-1992" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Perhaps in the future some more people would have been killed by the hazing protocol Code Red. Hard to estimate how many, but we’ll give 3 more lives saved.</p>
<h3 id="mission-impossible-1996"><strong>Mission: Impossible (1996)</strong> <a href="#mission-impossible-1996" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>When Ethan Hunt saves the NOC list from being released, we can guess a good number of those people would be killed as undercover spies. Perhaps the list had 1000 people, half of which would have been killed. 500 lives.</p>
<h3 id="mission-impossible-2-2000"><strong>Mission: Impossible 2 (2000)</strong> <a href="#mission-impossible-2-2000" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Ethan Hunt stops a pandemic this time around. The virus has a 100% mortality rate, so you would think this takes out a number in the billions over time. We’ll go with 3 billion.</p>
<h3 id="the-last-samurai-2003"><strong>The Last Samurai (2003)</strong> <a href="#the-last-samurai-2003" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Stops the slaughter of the village people. Perhaps 40 lives.</p>
<h3 id="collateral-2004"><strong>Collateral (2004)</strong> <a href="#collateral-2004" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Ends the career of a hitman. If the hitman were to continue his profession, let’s say he would’ve taken 30 more lives.</p>
<h3 id="war-of-the-worlds-2005"><strong>War of the Worlds (2005)</strong> <a href="#war-of-the-worlds-2005" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Really just saves his family. 5 lives.</p>
<h3 id="mission-impossible-iii-2006"><strong>Mission: Impossible III (2006)</strong> <a href="#mission-impossible-iii-2006" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>This is when Tom really turns it up a notch. Over the next 20 years, Tom Cruise is a world saving machine. It feels like every time he touches the screen there is an existential threat. In this case, the rabbit’s foot is a device that could cause global catastrophe. Of what nature, we do not know. Let’s go with 1 billion lives.</p>
<h3 id="mission-impossible--ghost-protocol-2011"><strong>Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011)</strong> <a href="#mission-impossible--ghost-protocol-2011" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Global nuclear war is at stake. Probable end to humanity. 7 billion lives.
**</p>
<h3 id="jack-reacher-2012"><strong>Jack Reacher (2012)</strong> <a href="#jack-reacher-2012" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Stops some further bloodshed. Minor. Maybe 5 lives.</p>
<h3 id="oblivion-2013"><strong>Oblivion (2013)</strong> <a href="#oblivion-2013" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>There actually are not that many people left alive in 2077, when the movie takes place. We see maybe a dozen on screen, and perhaps there are some more scattered about. So he saves the world, but that constitutes only 20 lives.</p>
<h3 id="edge-of-tomorrow-2014"><strong>Edge of Tomorrow (2014)</strong> <a href="#edge-of-tomorrow-2014" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>A very similar situation to Oblivion - the world is technically saved, but humans are in dire straits from the jump. Let’s say there are 100 million. Totally arbitrary guess.</p>
<h3 id="mission-impossible--rogue-nation-2015"><strong>Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (2015)</strong> <a href="#mission-impossible--rogue-nation-2015" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>While the world is not directly under threat by pandemic or nuclear weapons, the stability of the world is certainly under fire. With the potential of the world in chaos, that feels like a 500 million life debacle.</p>
<h3 id="the-mummy-2017"><strong>The Mummy (2017)</strong> <a href="#the-mummy-2017" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>The god of death is threatened to be released onto the world. Going give that 7.5 billion lives, given the time.</p>
<h3 id="mission-impossible--fallout-2018"><strong>Mission: Impossible – Fallout (2018)</strong> <a href="#mission-impossible--fallout-2018" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Massive nuclear fallout (hence the name) is at stake here. In addition to the deaths caused by the blast and aftermath, the turmoil the world is in will likely cost many more lives. 1 billion, let’s say.</p>
<h3 id="top-gun-maverick-2022"><strong>Top Gun: Maverick (2022)</strong> <a href="#top-gun-maverick-2022" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Saves his team. Also destroys the Uranium thing? Not sure if that’s really worth much. 20 lives, maybe.</p>
<h3 id="mission-impossible--dead-reckoning-part-one-2023-and--mission-impossible--the-final-reckoning-2025"><strong>Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (2023) and  Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning (2025)</strong> <a href="#mission-impossible--dead-reckoning-part-one-2023-and--mission-impossible--the-final-reckoning-2025" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Same storyline follows both of these two. What seems to be at stake is a world governed by a malicious AI. Seems like something liable to take out the human population. 8 billion lives.</p>
<h1 id="total-count">Total Count <a href="#total-count" class="anchor">🔗</a></h1><p>Over 40 years, the count comes to 33,100,010,624 lives.</p>
<p>There is also some population growth to be considered, e.g. the world saved in 2017 with a population of 7.5 billion would have grown to over 8 billion by now. Another complication is that the Mission Impossible lives being saved are presumably in the same universe, so we might be counting the same lives multiple times. What’s more, if you want to think about the long-term future in the way that an effective altruist might, saving billions of lives can eventually turn into trillions of lives if humanity sticks around for long enough. That all is a bit too tricky and abstract for a post about Tom Cruise movies, though.</p>
<p>One final note: given that he’s been in 55 movies, Tom averages a little over 600 million lives saved per movie.</p>
