Thanks for checking out my website! You'll see the main feature is a blog, which is a place for me to work on some things I find interesting. That often entails using statistics or learning methods on problems in decision making, whether it be in sports or card games or with money or wherever else. 

I tutor a variety of classes and it's always been something I enjoy, so if that interests you, check out the tab in the far top right.

If you want to reach out about a tutoring session or anything I've worked on here, feel free to use the links below to reach out. You'll find my email, GitHub, and LinkedIn.

Lastly, the coolest part of my website, my avatar, is a portrait of me made by my awesome sister.
