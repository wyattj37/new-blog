Hey, I'm Wyatt Johnston, a PhD student in OR at UT Austin. Before coming to Texas I completed my BS in Systems Engineering and Design from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Thanks for checking out my website!

On my <a href="/blog">blog</a> you'll find some smaller problems I've worked on and found interesting. I also have a few larger <a href="/projects">projects</a> with their own websites. In my spare time I like to work on crossword puzzles, and I've even <a href="/crossword">made a few</a> you can do yourself. 

A lot of the stuff on here (including the website itself) can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/wyattj37" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Feel free to reach out via the contacts on my [CV](/cv.pdf) or connect on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/wyatt-d-johnston" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.

Lastly, the <a href="/favicon-png.png" target="_blank">image</a> next to my name in the upper left is a portrait done by my fantastic sister.
