<h1 align="center"><b>Tutoring</b></h1>

I've spent a lot of time tutoring over the last 6 years. It's something I enjoy, and I think I've gotten pretty decent at it over time. I worked 6 semesters as a tutor in my college's engineering department, but I've had plenty of sessions working outside of college. If you, or someone you know, wants some extra help in any of the subjects below, feel free to reach out. Either in-person or virtual works just fine for me.
